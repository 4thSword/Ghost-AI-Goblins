## Overview

This project represents a study about how to train a Neaural Network to be able to play a retro game as Ghost'n Goblins by itself depending on its own experience towards hundred of tousand of aleatory instructions and the effect that it causes in each instant of time. 

### Why Ghosts'n Goblins

There is not the first time that someone train a nerual network to play videogame, ussually playig Super Mario Bros or Sonic the Hedgehog.
In this case I wondered if this kind of algorythms were able to play to Super Mario or Sonic, probably could be able to play other videogames that I considered more diffcult to play as is the case of GnG.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

 It differs from supervised learning in that labelled input/output pairs need not be presented, and sub-optimal actions need not be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge).

 In most AI topics, we create mathematical frameworks to tackle problems. For RL, the answer is the Markov Decision Process (MDP). It sounds complicated but it produces an easy framework to model a complex problem. An agent (e.g. a human) observes the environment and takes actions. Rewards are given out but they may be infrequent and delayed. Very often, the long-delayed rewards make it extremely hard to untangle the information and traceback what sequence of actions contributed to the rewards.

 In this case our environmet will be our Ghost'n golbings game running in OpenAI Gym-Retro environment tool, and our Agent will be a NEAT neural network.
